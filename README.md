Project title:  City of Toronto Budget Analysis (Financial planning)

Project Description: This initiative focuses on acquiring and analyzing comprehensive budgeting data for programs within the City of Toronto. Sourced from official government channels and municipal websites, the dataset encompasses crucial details, including program names, detailed expenditure and revenue categories, and corresponding budget amounts. Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights that will contribute to informed financial planning and decision-making processes for the City of Toronto.

Project Attributes:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the budget data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring data consistency. Perform initial checks to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct EDA to understand the characteristics of the budget data.
Explore basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
Visualize the distribution of budget allocations using histograms or box plots.
Identify outliers and anomalies in the data.

Expenditure Category Analysis:
Categorize expenditures into relevant categories (e.g., personnel, supplies, utilities).
Explore the distribution of expenditures across different categories using bar charts or pie charts.
Program Summary:

Create a program summary that aggregates expenditures by program.
Identify programs with the highest and lowest budgets.
Visualize the distribution of budgets across programs using bar charts or stacked bar charts.
Trend Analysis:

Analyze budget trends over multiple years if historical data is available.
Identify categories or programs with significant changes in budget allocations over time using line charts or time series plots.
Geospatial Analysis (Optional):

Comparison with Demographic Data:
Explore the relationship between budget allocations and demographic data for the City of Toronto. This could include factors such as population density, income levels, or other relevant indicators.

Correlation Analysis:
Investigate potential correlations between budget categories.
Explore whether increased spending in one category is associated with changes in another using correlation matrices or scatter plots

Capital vs. Operating Budget:
The proportion of the budget is allocated to capital projects versus ongoing operational expenses and any significant capital investments planned for the future.
