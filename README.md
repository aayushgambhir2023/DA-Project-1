# City of Toronto Budget Analysis (Financial planning)

## Description of the Project 

This project talks about 
This initiative focuses on acquiring and analyzing comprehensive budgeting data for programs within the City of Toronto. Sourced from official government channels and municipal websites, the dataset encompasses crucial details, including program names, detailed expenditure and revenue categories, and corresponding budget amounts. Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights that will contribute to informed financial planning and decision-making processes for the City of Toronto.

The analysis we're going to do is .. 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Conduct EDA to understand the characteristics of the budget data.
   Explore basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
   Visualize the distribution of budget allocations using histograms or box plots.
   Identify outliers and anomalies in the data.
2. Expenditure Category Analysis:
   Categorize expenditures into relevant categories (e.g., personnel, supplies, utilities).
   Explore the distribution of expenditures across different categories using bar charts or pie charts.
3. Program Summary:
   Create a program summary that aggregates expenditures by program.
   Identify programs with the highest and lowest budgets.
   Visualize the distribution of budgets across programs using bar charts or stacked bar charts.
4. Trend Analysis:
   Analyze budget trends over multiple years if historical data is available.
   Identify categories or programs with significant changes in budget allocations over time using line charts or time series plots.
5. Predictive Modeling:
   Explore the possibility of building predictive models to forecast future budget allocations based on historical trends.
6. Comparison with Demographic Data:
   Explore the relationship between budget allocations and demographic data for the City of Toronto. This could include factors such as population density, income levels, or other relevant indicators.
7. Correlation Analysis:
   Investigate potential correlations between budget categories.
   Explore whether increased spending in one category is associated with changes in another using correlation matrices or scatter plots

The questions we're going to answer are: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. What is the trend in the overall city's budget and also the projection looking at a 10 year period (using a 3 year moving average)?
   What Budget Categories have higher variation the most in terms of Revenue?
   What Budget Categories have increased the most in terms of costs?
   What Trends can be observed amongst the most and less profitable city programs?
5.
6. Does the area demographic affect the budget allocation?

## Limitations
For Demographic impact â€“ Federal Electoral District data for 2021 was obtained from Census Canada which uses only 25% sample data. Ward profiles from the City of Toronto only publicly show 2016, and after contacting the Social Policy Analysis & Research unit of the Social Development, Finance and Administration division at the City of Toronto, they stated that the 2021 profiles are in the process of being created and should be out soon, and directed me to the data from Statistics Canada.

## File Problems
98-401-X2021010_English_CSV_data.csv was too large to commit to github at 180MB, so some data that were irrelavent were deleted as it contains the census of electorial wards of all of Canada, and only the data for Toronto was needed.
